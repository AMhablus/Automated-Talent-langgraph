About the job
Company Description

Aralects is developing a gamified, self-paced app focused on teaching Arabic dialects like Egyptian, Lebanese, and Emirati to enhance real-world conversational skills. Personalized learning pathways powered by AI aim to make language learning more engaging and accessible. The company is committed to creating a culturally immersive platform for mastering Arabic dialects, catering to a wide audience for professional growth or personal interest.

Role Description

We're looking for a passionate AI Engineer to join Aralects on a full-time basis (remote or hybrid). You'll be working alongside experts in AI, NLP, and language learning, helping to shape a next-generation platform for Arabic learners worldwide. This is a chance to make a real impact, contribute to a meaningful product, and be part of a collaborative, ambitious team.

We welcome candidates who are eager to grow their skills and contribute in areas like: AI agent development, deep learning, large language model (LLM) fine-tuning, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), speech processing, prompt engineering, and more.

Responsibilities

Design, build, and optimize AI-driven features for language learning, including conversational agents and recommendation systems
Develop tools for processing Arabic dialects (morphological analyzers, generators, speech-to-text, text-to-speech, alignment, automatic annotation, etc.)
Contribute to backend development, building scalable APIs and services to support AI features
Fine-tune LLMs and other AI models for educational and language learning applications
Stay up-to-date on the latest research and best practices in AI, deep learning, and NLP
Collaborate closely with the software team to integrate AI components into the Aralects platform
Document solutions and share insights with the team
(Bonus) Contribute to research initiatives or publishing


Qualifications

3+ years of experience (projects, industry, not academic) in Python programming
1+ years of hands-on experience with PyTorch (academic or industry projects)
1+ years of experience with Arabic NLP, language technology, or similar linguistic AI projects
Fluency in Arabic is required as the role involves developing and evaluating Arabic language learning materials and technologies.
Bachelor or Masters degree (completed or in progress) in Computer Science, AI, Computational Linguistics, Machine Learning, or a related field
Experience with Python backend development (e.g., FastAPI, Django, Node.js), including designing APIs and integrating AI models into production systems
Familiarity with frontend frameworks (e.g., React, Next.js, Vue) and integrating backend services with user interfaces
Good understanding of deploying, maintaining, and monitoring AI models in production environments
Proficiency in using Docker for containerization and deployment
Experience with cloud platforms (e.g., AWS, GCP, Azure) and CI/CD pipelines is a strong plus
Good command of software version control (e.g., Git) and collaborative development workflows
Bonus: Experience with data engineering, MLOps, or research publication"""
